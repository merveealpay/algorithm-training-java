Techopedia explains Algorithm:

An algorithm is a detailed series of instructions for carrying out an operation or solving a problem. 
In a non-technical approach, we use algorithms in everyday tasks, such as a recipe to bake a cake or 
a do-it-yourself handbook.

Technically, computers use algorithms to list the detailed instructions for carrying out an operation.
For example, to compute an employeeâ€™s paycheck, the computer uses an algorithm.
To accomplish this task, appropriate data must be entered into the system.


I develop myself to learn simple but important algorithms, I write with java.
